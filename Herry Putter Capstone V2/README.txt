Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0p3
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0

Took 4.5 Weeks (stopped counting hours)
Liked: exploring with no limits
Challenged: First time I really had to think about object assets in this course. So those became the bare minimum for completion, but I plan to continue developing them.

Spatial Audio Objects:
1. Scene1 - Crests spatial audio
2. Scene2 - Hat spatial audio

3. Scene4 - Troll steps spatial audio


Game Instructions: 
*Read the instructions listed in each scene
1) Walk into brick archway
2) Walk to Hat and pick up, place on head (exists a small collider, so may take some fiddling/fitting)
3) Answer the question verbally, which starts a timer to load next scene
4) Use Spell (via verbal) to activate spells to either pick up object or kill troll
5) Simply bask in your house achievement

ACHIEVEMENTS:
1. Fundamentals (600) - All except Video Player
2. Completeness (500) - A) Gamification Achievement: The User is rewarded with a 3D Model of their house crest once passing the Troll test, B) 3D Modeling: Created my owm objects in Blender (and animated) -BrichArch & WalkingTroll
3. Challenges (500) - Speech Recognition achievement: User has to say spell names in order to activate spells
